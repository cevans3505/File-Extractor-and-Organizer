# File-Extractor-and-Organizer
Python 3 script that will extract files from subdirectories matching specified file extension(s) to specified directory and delete leftover/unwanted files and subdirectories.

NOTE: This is very much a WORK IN PROGRESS and you risk accidentally deleting lots of unintended files/folders if you don't take the necessary precautions to verify everything is correct.

BEFORE running the script, comment out line #69 and line #83, then run the script to verify all the correct files will be extracted and that no files/folders will be deleted that you do not wish to intend to be deleted. After you verify everything is correct, only then should you un-comment line #69 and line #83.

Again, this is very much a WIP and anyone considering making use of this script is HIGHLY advised to make backups before doing so. You've been warned!
