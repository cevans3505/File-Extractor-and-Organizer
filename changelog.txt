v0.1
*	Created very basic python routine to extract all files from all subdirectories into parent directory

v0.2
*	Added user configurable array (keepExts) to define specific file extensions the user wishes to extract leaving unwanted file extensions in their respective directories
*	Added user configurable variable (destDir) to define the absolute dir path to store extracted files

v0.2.1
* Added user configurable array (skipDirs) to define specifc directories to omit from file extractor subroutine.

v0.3
* Added directory deletion routine to delete the directories from which all wanted files were previously extracted

v0.4
* Fleshed out the user configuration section
* Code cleanup
* Fully functional as of this version. However, strongly advise commenting out line #69 and line #83 and running the script to verify the correct file extensions are being extracted to the correct directory and that no directories are being deleted that you actually intend to keep.
